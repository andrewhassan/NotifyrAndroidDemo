Notifyr Android Demo
====================

This repository holds the Android application code for Praetzel's demo in 4A. The app simply has a textbox and a send button. When the button is pressed, the text from the text box will be sent and displayed on the Notifyr. The app will need to discover devices first, but then will have to remeber the Notifyr device to automatically connect after initial setup.

This application demos our ability to take input, send it to the device, and display it properly.
